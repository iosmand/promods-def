# this directory a new file "<base_name>.<idofyourmod>.sui" where <base_name> is name of
# base file without the extension (e.g. "city" for "/def/city.sui") and <idofyourmod> is
# some string which is unlikely to conflict with other mod.

# Warning: Even if the units are specified in more than one source file, they share the
# same namespace so suffixes or prefixes should be used to avoid conflicts.
